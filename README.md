This is the code that runs [Project It Yourself!](http://macwright.org/projectityourself/),
a toy that lets you play with [map projections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection)
as simple math functions.

There's also a [blog post](http://macwright.org/2012/03/12/project-it-yourself.html) and
[a presentation](http://macwright.org/presentations/projections/#0) for background.

Technology-wise it uses [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Canvas_tutorial),
a version of NASA's [blue marble](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/)
image, and a bunch of eval.
